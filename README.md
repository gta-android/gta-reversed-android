### How to Set Up and Build in Android Studio 

Wanna get started? It’s simple! Follow these steps:  

1. **Download Android Studio**  
   If you don’t have Android Studio yet, grab it here: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).  

2. **Clone the repository**  
   Fire up your terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gta-android/gta-android.git
   cd gta-android
   ```  

3. **Open it in Android Studio**  
   - Launch Android Studio.  
   - Click **"Open"** and select the folder where you just cloned the project and select the **"Android"** folder.

4. **Install dependencies**  
   Android Studio should automatically detect and set up the dependencies. If not, go to **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files**.  

5. **Set up a test device**  
   - Use an Android emulator from Android Studio or connect a real Android device.  
   - Make sure **USB Debugging** is enabled on your device.  

6. **Build and run**  
   - Click the **Run** button (the ▶️ icon) in the top bar.  
   - Choose your test device, sit back, and let it do its thing!
